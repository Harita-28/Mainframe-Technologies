Steps involved:-

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
1. Log in to IBM z/OS using TSO/ISPF
2. Navigate to ISPF 3.2 to create and manage datasets.
3. Ensure access to DFSORT for sorting operations.
4. Verify JCL execution capabilities using JES2/JES3.

Step 2: Creating the Input Dataset
1. Use ISPF 3.2 to allocate a Physical Sequential (PS) file.
2. Define a dataset with 100 records, each 80 bytes in length.
3. Ensure the primary key is located in columns 13-20.
4. Include 10 duplicate records and randomize the data order.

Step 3: Writing the JCL SORT Job
1. Use JCL to define and process the dataset.
2. Implement DFSORT to:
3. Eliminate duplicate records.
4. Sort remaining records based on the primary key (columns 13-20).
5. Define the input and output datasets.

Step 4: Executing the JCL Job
1. Submit the JCL script using SUB JCLFILE.
2. Monitor job execution in SDSF (System Display and Search Facility).
3. Verify the output dataset to ensure records are sorted and duplicates removed.

Step 5: Validating the Output Dataset
1. Open the output dataset in ISPF Edit/View mode.
2. Confirm that:
3. All 90 unique records are present.
4. Records are sorted in ascending order based on columns 13-20.
