Steps Involved:-

Step 1: Environment Setup
1. Install and configure a COBOL development environment such as IBM z/OS, VS Code with Zowe, or a mainframe emulator like Hercules.
2. Ensure availability of a COBOL compiler (IBM Enterprise COBOL for mainframes or GnuCOBOL for local use).
3. Set up JCL execution support using JES2/JES3 for running batch processes.

Step 2: Preparing Input Datasets
1. Create two Physical Sequential (PS) files:
    a. File1: 50 records, 80 bytes each, with the primary key located in columns 13-20.
    b. File2: 50 records, 80 bytes each, with the primary key in columns 21-28.
2. Allocate these datasets on the mainframe using ISPF or JCL.
3. Populate both files with sample data, ensuring the presence of matching and non-matching records.

Step 3: Developing the COBOL Program
1. Define file structures in the FILE SECTION of the COBOL program.
2. Implement the INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION to handle opening, reading, and processing of both files.
3. Extract and compare the primary keys from File1 and File2.
4. Write only matching records to the output file (File3).
5. Include error handling for missing or incorrectly formatted records.
6. Ensure input files are sorted for optimal performance.

Step 4: Setting Up the Output Dataset
1. Create File3, a Physical Sequential (PS) file, to store matching records.
2. Use JCL to allocate the dataset with appropriate attributes.
3. Write the matching records from File1 and File2 into File3.

Step 5: Writing and Running JCL
1. Develop a JCL script to:
    a. Define input and output datasets.
    b. Compile and execute the COBOL program.
    c. Use DFSORT to sort input files if required.
    d. Validate the output dataset to confirm the expected results.
2. Submit the JCL job and check for successful execution.
